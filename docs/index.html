But made out of candy. And popsicles. And ice cream. And the blender mixer mixes everything to make a new kind of delicious smell. I call this Candy City. And sling shot, its shot candy to each house.</p>

And also there is a... there is a water dish... dish. And there are logs at the end. And there are tomatoes and also a cabbage leaf. And the back should go in... here.
